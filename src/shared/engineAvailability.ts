/**
 * Can the engine a user is about to pick actually boot on this machine?
 *
 * The onboarding wizard records Michael's engine and nothing checks it until the
 * first spawn. spawnAgentCore then runs the install ladder (cliInstall.ts), and
 * for a provider with no `installCommand` and no `nativeInstallCommand` that
 * ladder ends at the `manual` rung: a hint is printed in a terminal and the
 * orchestrator never starts. This module turns the setup catalog probe
 * (`tools:status`, which already resolves every engine binary on PATH) into one
 * answer per provider so the wizard can say so BEFORE the pick is committed.
 *
 * Pure and electron-free on purpose so it is testable from node --test.
