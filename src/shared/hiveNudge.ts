/**

 * is idle and off cooldown, and it survives a renderer reload in the persisted
 * queue. By the time it lands, the agent has often already drained that mail and
 * filed it under `inbox/.done/` — so the nudge arrives against an inbox the agent

 * me for nothing", which is the distinction it otherwise cannot make and burns a
 * round-trip guessing at. The pending inbox stays authoritative — an agent that
