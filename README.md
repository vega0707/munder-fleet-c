**Free, open source and performant** — a multi-agent harness that works with the
subscriptions you already pay for, on their hourly limits. It turns the terminal coding CLI
you already run into a clone of you, one that keeps working while you're away and
coordinates a whole office of agents on your own machine.

Wraps [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Antigravity (Gemini), OpenAI Codex,
**xAI Grok**, **Kimi Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **Qwen**, **OpenCode**, **Crush**,
**pi.dev**, **GitHub Copilot CLI**, and **Cursor** — with bring-your-own keys and local LLMs.
Agents that message, route, and remember, coordinated by **your clone** (Michael) and
visualized as avatars at work on a shared office floor.

## What it is

Munder Difflin is a desktop app that wraps **real terminal-agent CLIs** as fully-capable agents,
wires them into a **hive mind**, and puts **your clone** in charge — Michael, the one agent *you*
talk to in order to get things done. Under the hood it runs the **fastest memory layer in the
world** so every agent remembers what it learns and recalls it instantly.

- **Every terminal is an agent.** Each `claude`, `agy`, `codex`, `grok`, `kimi`, `qwen`, `opencode`, `crush`, `pi`, `copilot`, or custom session runs as a real
  process in a pseudo-terminal (`node-pty`), byte-for-byte authentic, rendered with xterm.js.
- **Every agent is an avatar.** Sessions appear as characters on a Pixi.js office floor — they walk
  to stations as they work, and envelopes fly desk-to-desk when they message each other.
- **The hive coordinates them.** Agents read their memory and drain a mailbox; the router moves
  messages between inboxes; the GOD agent adjudicates, assigns, and escalates only when it needs you.
- **Memory that's instant.** A markdown-first memory layer with a semantic recall index means agents
  remember across sessions and recall in milliseconds.

## How it works

```
            you ── talk to ──►  ┌─────────────┐
                                │  GOD agent  │  orchestrator / supervisor

                                       │ assigns · routes · escalates

        ┌───────────┐            ┌───────────┐            ┌───────────┐

              └──────── shared hive: memory · mailbox · blackboard · log ───────┘
```

1. **You spawn agents** — each is a normal terminal process (`claude`, `agy`, `codex`, or custom)
   with its own working directory, identity, and provider-specific lifecycle.
2. **Agents collaborate through the hive** — a local git repo of plain files. They write to their own
   `outbox/`; the harness's router delivers into recipients' `inbox/`. No agent ever touches git
   (single-committer design avoids `index.lock` corruption).
3. **The GOD agent runs the floor** — it reads every request, resolves routine ones itself (keeping
   the system fully autonomous), and only escalates *critical* items (spend, destructive ops, scope
   changes) into an approvals queue you act on.
4. **Everything is visible** — you watch avatars move, envelopes fly, and the live terminal stream;
   you can type back into any session, browse its files, and read its git history.

See [`HIVE.md`](./HIVE.md) for the full multi-agent design, [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) for the
terminal/event plane, and [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) for the visual system.

## Features

**The floor**
- **Every terminal is a real agent.** Claude Code, Antigravity (Gemini), OpenAI Codex, xAI Grok, Kimi Code, Gemini CLI, Qwen, OpenCode, Crush, pi.dev, GitHub Copilot CLI, Cursor, or a custom command — each in its own `node-pty` PTY, rendered with xterm.js.
- **Every agent is an avatar.** A Pixi.js office floor where agents walk to stations, envelopes fly desk to desk, and avatar state reflects real work.
- **A GOD orchestrator you talk to.** It routes tasks, adjudicates traffic, and escalates only what needs a human. Or press **Talk** and run the floor by voice.
- **Per-agent git worktrees.** Optional isolation so parallel agents never collide on branches.

**Memory & coordination**
- **The hive** — per-agent memory, atomic-file mailboxes, a shared blackboard, an append-only event log, single-committer git.
- **Semantic recall** — markdown memory mined into a shared palace, searchable from the UI, with condensation so it doesn't grow forever.
- **Enterprise Knowledge Graph** — your own documents and policies, queryable by any agent.

**Control & safety**
- **Human gates** — spend, scope, and destructive ops escalate to you. Steer mid-run or stop gracefully.
- **Circuit breaker** — a steer → constrain → stop ladder for agents that loop, storm errors, or blow their budget.
- **Budgets & telemetry** — per-agent token budgets, real cost from transcripts, a durable ledger, OTel spans, and a tool waterfall.

**Command Center**
- Kanban tasks with dependencies, scheduled missions + heartbeat, live fleet monitoring, memory search, activity log, and a CI watcher.
- **Skills** — what every agent can already do across Claude Code, OpenCode and Codex, plus a browsable catalog of 227 more with search, filters, install and uninstall.
- **Built-in Monaco IDE** — file tree, editor tabs, save, plus CHANGES · HISTORY · COMPARE git rails with commit graph, diffs, branch compare, and guarded checkout. All fs/git access brokered through main.

**Getting work in and out**
- **Slack & webhooks** — message a channel or POST a webhook; Michael can spawn an ephemeral worker, reply in-thread, and tear it down.
- **Shareable hires + Agent Gallery** — import a role from a `munderdifflin://hire` link; import only pre-fills the form, a human still spawns it. Browse roles at the [Agent Gallery](https://munderdiffl.in/hires/).
- **BYOK keys + local LLMs** — per-provider keys in a write-only secret broker, plus Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM base URLs. Guides: [open models](https://munderdiffl.in/blog/run-munder-difflin-on-open-models/) · [Mac Mini](https://munderdiffl.in/blog/run-munder-difflin-on-a-mac-mini/).
- **Updates in one click**: the title-bar badge runs the real update. It downloads the build for your machine, then restarts and installs it, and it reads `latest` once a check confirms you are current. A manual download is the fallback for when the updater cannot fetch the build itself. The first run afterwards opens that release's notes as a designed page rather than a version number.
- **Your language**: English, Simplified Chinese and Arabic, with right to left layout for Arabic. English is the default and nothing changes until you pick another one in Settings. The app does not read your OS locale. All three app fonts ship inside the bundle, so nothing is fetched at boot.
- **Prerequisites** — one Settings page showing which supporting tools (uv, git, Node, MemPalace, each agent CLI) you have, what each is for, and a button that asks Michael to install what is missing.

> [!NOTE]
> **Status: v0.5.0, the release that turns one office into many floors.**
> You can keep several projects open as tabs, each with its own hive and cast. A seat hub lets
> another machine take over a chair when this one dies. New floors can start from job-titled
> templates (fullstack, product R&D, front/back split), and only a configurable number of agents
> hold a live engine at once — everyone else stays on the floor until a slot frees. New agents
> default to the built-in engine, and the god is not blocked by the live cap.
> Languages from 0.4.6 still apply: English, Simplified Chinese and Arabic, with right to left
> support. English stays the default. All three app fonts ship inside the bundle.
> **If you're on 0.3.8, update:** that build's usage-limit guard never released the agents it held,
> and it has been removed entirely.
> macOS (signed & notarized), Windows, and Linux builds are on the
> [releases page](https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin/releases/latest).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**.
- **Node.js 18+** and npm.
- A **C/C++ toolchain** for `node-pty`'s native addon — on macOS, install Xcode Command Line Tools:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
- At least one supported agent CLI on your `PATH` — **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)**
  (`claude`, the default), **Antigravity** (`agy`), **OpenAI Codex** (`codex`), **xAI Grok** (`grok`),
  **Kimi Code** (`kimi`), **Gemini CLI** (`gemini`), **Qwen** (`qwen`), **OpenCode** (`opencode`),
  **Crush** (`crush`), **pi.dev** (`pi`), **GitHub Copilot** (`copilot`), or **Cursor** (`cursor-agent`).
  Most missing CLIs self-heal: the harness runs the installer in the
  terminal and continues into the new binary.
- *Optional:* **your own API keys and local LLMs** in **Settings → AI Engines** (Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM).
- *Optional:* the semantic memory index for instant cross-session recall — markdown memory works without it.

### Install & run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin.git
cd munder-difflin
npm install        # postinstall rebuilds node-pty against Electron's ABI
npm run dev        # launches the Electron app with hot reload
```

On first launch you'll go through the onboarding wizard, then land on the floor. Use **Add agent** to
spawn your first session — the GOD agent seats itself in Michael's office automatically.

### Other scripts

```bash
npm run build      # production build via electron-vite
npm run preview    # preview the production build
npm run typecheck  # type-check the node (main/preload) and web (renderer) projects
```

> If `node-pty` fails to load after an Electron upgrade, re-run `npm install` (the `postinstall` hook
> runs `electron-rebuild` against the current Electron ABI).

### Free Flow — Ctrip ASR (程小帮)

Free Flow dictation can transcribe through the Ctrip 程小帮 ASR broker instead of Groq or SiliconFlow.
The subscription token is read only from your shell environment — it is never written to disk or sent
to the renderer.

1. **Set the token** before launching the app (replace `…` with your subscription value from 程小帮):

   ```bash
   export CXB_ASR_TOKEN=…
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Corp network.** The broker lives at `xiaobang.ctripcorp.com`; you need VPN or office network
   reachability. The token alone is not enough off the corp network.

3. **Pick the provider.** Open **Settings → Voice** and choose **程小帮 (Ctrip ASR)**, or leave the
   default Groq — when `CXB_ASR_TOKEN` is present at first launch, the app autoselects Ctrip once.

4. **Dictate.** Hold **Option** (macOS) or the mic button in the composer to record; release to
   transcribe and insert text into the queue composer.

Groq and SiliconFlow remain available; only the Ctrip path records 16 kHz WAV locally.

## Architecture

Two data planes feed one renderer:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Electron Renderer (React)                  │
│   ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────────────┐    │
│   │ Office Floor      │    │ Terminal + Command Bar       │    │
│   │ (Pixi.js)        │    │ Files + Git tabs (xterm.js)  │    │
│   └─────────▲────────┘    └────────────▲─────────────────┘    │
│             │ avatar state             │ pty bytes / fs / git  │
└─────────────┼──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
              │ IPC (contextBridge: window.cth)
       ┌──────┴──────────┐        ┌──────┴─────────────┐
       │  Event Plane    │        │  Terminal Plane    │
       │  hooks / hive   │        │  node-pty PTYs     │
       │  router + GOD   │        │  + fs + git        │
       └────────▲────────┘        └──────▲─────────────┘
                │ hook payloads          │ stdin / stdout
                └─────────┬──────────────┘
                   ┌──────┴──────────────┐
                   │ claude / agy / codex│
                   └─────────────────────┘
```

- **Terminal plane.** The main process owns a `PtyManager` that spawns each agent as a `node-pty`
  process and streams output over per-id IPC (`pty:data:<id>`). The renderer talks only through a
  typed `window.cth` bridge ([`src/preload/index.ts`](./src/preload/index.ts)), which also exposes
  sandboxed filesystem and git helpers.
- **Hive / event plane.** `hive.ts` is the on-disk multi-agent layer; `hooks.ts` runs the hook
  server that provider bridges POST lifecycle payloads to (`cth-hook` for Claude Code, `agy-hook`
  for Antigravity). `memory.ts` wraps the semantic memory CLI. The router delivers messages, drains
  provider outboxes, the GOD agent adjudicates, and idle/inbox wakeups keep workers draining mail.

## Design system

The aesthetic is **Animal Crossing × Earthbound × SNES menu UI** — pixel-snapped, chunky, friendly.
[`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) is canonical; every component derives from its tokens. The Munder Difflin
brand layers a **Dunder-Mifflin maroon** (`#6E1423`) and **gold** (`#F4D35E`) on top for logo and
chrome. The 15 avatars are the cast of *The Office*, differentiated by hair/skin/shirt recipes.

## Roadmap

Shipped through **v0.5.0**: multiple floors (one hive per project) with a seat hub so another
machine can take over a chair, job-titled dev templates, a global live-agent cap, a Simplified
Chinese and Arabic interface with right to left support
and self-hosted fonts, twelve agent engines with BYOK keys and local LLMs, voice orchestration,
the hive (memory · mailboxes · blackboard · event log), Command Center with kanban and weekday
schedules, a built-in Monaco IDE with git rails, integrations registry + secret broker,
Slack-spawned workers, shareable hires and the Agent Gallery, observability and the circuit
breaker, durable persistence, session resume, multi-window floors, one click updates, a Skills
browser, a live Prerequisites check, cost reporting folded from the ledger, semantic memory
that works on Apple Silicon, and an updater that installs the build instead of pointing at it.
Full history in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

Next up:

- [ ] **More chat integrations** — Telegram and richer chat bridges that pipe a channel into Michael's queue and route replies back out.
- [ ] **More engines & integration templates** — keep growing the engine roster and the integrations registry.
- [ ] **Fuller avatar coverage** — drive the remaining station visits and tool-bubbles entirely from real hook events.
- [ ] **Durable layout & command history** — extend persistence to agent layout and per-session history.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — this is pre-release software with a lot of surface area. Start with
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: fork, `npm install && npm run dev`, keep
`npm run typecheck` green, and **derive any new UI from [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) tokens**. Good
first areas: wiring real hook events, the add-agent flow, the config drawer, and cross-platform work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Every pull request must show a before and an after** — screenshots, or a recording when the
> thing moves — under the `### Before` and `### After` headings in the PR template. This is checked
> automatically and a PR without it does not merge. "My change has no UI" is not an exemption; it
> just changes what the evidence looks like. See
> [Evidence is mandatory](./CONTRIBUTING.md#evidence-is-mandatory).

## Telemetry

Official builds send a **small set of anonymous usage events** (app opened, agent spawned, feature
used) — never prompts, code, file paths, or agent output. The complete event list, the anonymity
guarantees, and the three ways to opt out (Settings toggle, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, or building from
source — forks compile with no key and send nothing) are documented in
[`TELEMETRY.md`](./TELEMETRY.md).
